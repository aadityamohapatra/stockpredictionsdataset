Dataset is not owned by us and is exported from www.kaggle.com, link provided below: 

dataset used : https://www.kaggle.com/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset?select=etfs

data available : time series values of opening,closing,high,low and adj low prices of stocks listed on various stock markets, available for both stocks and etf's ranging from    1990-2020


Using the dataset provided, our goal was to clean and order the dataset before the actual analysis part. One of our goals is also to perform an analysis to develop a model, using random forest/neural networks/multivariable regression to be able to train a model to ultimately predict the required attribute of a stock/etf later in the future.
